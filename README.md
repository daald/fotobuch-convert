Fotobuch-Convert
================

What is this?
-------------

This project is the beginning of a big photo book conversion tool. I started with an ifolor.ch to scribus converter. scribut is an open source DTP tool which allows to modify the document and/or to export it to PDF or SVG.

I'm willing to also support other formats and hopefully to support cross conversions between them.

Also, if you find another format which is probable even better than scribus (scribus still has some missing features like shadows, picture frame and vertical text alignment), just tell me about it. What I don't want is to support a closed source software like Microsoft Publisher etc. Anyway: an implementation of a PowerPoint exporter might be possible to realize in short time by using Apache POI library.

There are also other photo products which are not supported yet (ifolor designer does not support them), but I think the base of this tool should be able to manage them too.

Current state is alpha. You can try out my prototype. It might be good enough for you to get the desired result. Give me feedback what you would like to improve.

A brief how-to: [[HowToUse]]

See the project page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/fotobuchconvert/




A word about my motivation: I don't want to damage any of those photo book production companies. But the problem is that all of them have a proprietary format and proprietary tools and they are not even willing to support export or conversion of those files. But nobody knows if these formats are still supported in 20 years. This is the main reason why I want to create a PDF of every digital document I ever produced. I asked ifolor if they want to help me and they didn't. So I helped myself.
